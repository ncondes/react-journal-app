## My process

### Built with

### What I learned and put into practice

- Make the layout ( structure and styles ) of the app
- Redux ( types, actions, reducers, store )
- Validations in the form inputs
- CRUD ( Create, Read, Update, Delete )
- Unit and integration test with jest and enzyme
- Store the data on Firestore, and Cloudinary for the images
- Deploy the app

### Useful resources
